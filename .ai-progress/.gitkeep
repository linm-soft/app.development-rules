# AI Progress Tracking - Keep All Files in This Folder

# This development-rules/.ai-progress folder contains AI session management 
# templates and guidelines that should be shared across all projects.
# 
# COMMIT TO GIT: All files in this folder should be tracked
# - ai-progress-tracking-quick.md (essential workflow)
# - ai-progress-tracking.md (detailed reference)
# - Any future templates and examples
#
# Unlike project-specific .ai-progress folders (which should be gitignored),
# this development-rules/.ai-progress folder provides shared standards.

# For project folders, add to .gitignore:
# .ai-progress/
# .ai-completed/

# Keep all files in this development-rules/.ai-progress/ folder committed to git
